<p>Shh did you hear that too?<br>
Or was it only me?<br>
Poor thing is carrying<br> 
Like a million things with a key.</p>

<img src="images/image7.jpg" class="photoleft">
<p>Holding things like an active volcano,<br>
She must let it out,<br>
It’s killing her inside,<br>
Stuck with a benefit of a doubt.</p>

<img src="images/image8.jpg" class="photoright">
<p>It’s not about if she deserves that,<br>
Because no one does,<br>
It’s about the happiness,<br>
In the beginning which was.</p>

<img src="images/image11.jpg" class="photoleft">
<p>She’s fighting herself daily,<br>
Battling with the two ends,<br>
One says just let go,<br>
One says careful your heart depends.</p>

<img src="images/image10.jpg" class="photoright">
<p>Maybe this will come around,<br>
It’s just a rough patch,<br>
Maybe it won’t,<br>
I guess it was a wrong match.</p>
