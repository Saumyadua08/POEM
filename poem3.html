<p>â€œHere we go again",<br>                                                                                                                                                                        
rushed to your buzzing phone,<br>      
It's been nine or ten,<br>
You're here, yet I feel alone.</p>

<img src="images/image9.jpg" class="photoleft">
<p>Is it even fun anymore?<br>
I see lies, lies, and lies,<br>
At least we were happy before,<br>
Can't bring that back despite a dozen tries.</p>

<img src="images/image10.jpg" class="photoright">
<p>"Everyone's beautiful", mom said,<br>
"But not you", Virtual world corrected,<br>
I know it's all in my head,<br>
This boiling feeling of being dejected.</p>

<img src="images/image7.jpg" class="photoleft">
<p>It was meant to be a happy place,<br>
Somewhere you could chill,<br>
But now I hate my face,<br>
cry, sleep, cry, You know the drill.</p>

<img src="images/image11.jpg" class="photoright">
<p>Evil forces have clearly overtaken,<br>
No one dares redeem,<br>
Oh, it's not satan,<br>
Worse, it's your hatred and low self-esteem.</p>
