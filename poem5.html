<p>Those who are left with bare remains,<br>
Those are the only ones who lost more, less gains.<br>
Maybe I’m one of those, maybe you too,<br>
Does it hurt? When everyone expects best out of you.</p>

<img src="images/image9.jpg" class="photoleft">
<p>Like how does one even cope with that?<br>
You feel hollow despite whatever you get.<br>
I don’t believe in unicorns and rainbows,<br>
I’m just watching the stream of time as it goes.</p>

<img src="images/image7.jpg" class="photoright">
<p>Everyone seems so happy and satisfied,<br>
I wish I could be too putting all my negatives aside.<br>
Why is it so absurd and important?<br>
I take joy in life as a supplement.</p>
